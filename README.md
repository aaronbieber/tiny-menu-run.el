# Tiny Menu #

[![MELPA](http://melpa.org/packages/tiny-menu-badge.svg)](http://melpa.org/#/tiny-menu)

Tiny Menu gives you the ability to define any number of menus that can be
presented on demand in the minibuffer. The net effect would be similar to
defining various prefix commands and using a package like `which-key` or
`guide-key` to display the available key maps upon pressing each prefix.

Menu items must be triggered by a single key press, and it is up to you whether
you wish to create a key mapping to trigger the menus, or trigger them in some
other fashion.

## Installation ##

Installing Tiny Menu is no different from installing any other package; place
the `tiny-menu.el` script in your load path (or add its path to your load path),
and call `(require 'tiny-menu)`.

The recommended method is to install this package from MELPA using the method of
your choice; I use John Wiegley's `use-package` macro, like this:

`(use-package tiny-menu :ensure t)`

## Usage ##

To use the tiny menu, simply define the `tiny-menu-items` variable and then map
keys to the items using the `tiny-menu-run-item` macro.

`tiny-menu-items` is an alist of menus ("items") where each menu key is the name
of the menu and its value is the menu contents.  The menu contents is a list
whose car is the name of the menu and cdr is a list of menu items.  Each menu
item is a list with three elements: the raw character code a user must press to
select the item, the display name for the item, and the function to be called
when the item is selected.

For example, it might look like this:

```
'(("buffer-menu" ("Buffer operations"
                  ((?k "Kill" kill-this-buffer)
                   (?b "Bury" bury-buffer))))
  ("help-menu"   ("Help operations"
                  ((?f "Describe function" describe-function)
                   (?k "Describe key"      describe-key)))))
```

This value defines two menus, one named "buffer-menu" and another named
"help-menu".  Calling `tiny-menu` with no arguments will display a menu of
available menus using alphabetical prompt keys.  Calling `tiny-menu` with the
name of a menu will launch that specific menu.

If you want to add a key mapping for a specific menu, you can use the
`tiny-menu-run-item` macro, like this:

`(define-key some-map (kbd "<key>") (tiny-menu-run-item "buffer-menu"))`

The macro returns an anonymous interactive function suitable for key binding.

It may also be useful (though not required) to use a custom prefix key if all of
the menus are related.  This is covered in other Emacs documentation, but for
the sake of convenience, this is how you could do that:

```
(define-prefix-command tiny-menu-map)
(define-key tiny-menu-map
  (kbd "<menu-key-1>") (tiny-menu-run-item "menu-1"))
(define-key tiny-menu-map
  (kbd "<menu-key-2>") (tiny-menu-run-item "menu-2"))
(define-key global-map (kbd "<prefix>") tiny-menu-map)
```
